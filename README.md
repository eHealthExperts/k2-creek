A Microsoft Windows [binary](https://github.com/eHealthExperts/k2-creek/releases/latest) that extract data from the electronic health insurance card via K2

It then extracts relevant fields and writes out some XML/binary files (compatible with WINCrd2XML from Sagem Monetel).

## Requirements

* **K2** from eHealth Experts GmbH

## Usage

Copy the [binary](https://github.com/eHealthExperts/k2-creek/releases/latest) into a desired folder. After the binary was executed, the card information at the configured K2 path will be written into [some files](tests/writer) next to the executable.

## Configuration

Execute `k2-creek.exe --help` to see the command line configuration options.

Alternatively locate a file `config.ini` next to the binary to configure the URL to work with.

The following example shows the default values.

```ini
[k2]
api=2
timeout= # default is no timeout
url= # no default

[output]
force_delete=false
path=.
```

* `force_delete` is for avoiding interaction when older generated files were found at the target destination. Setting this to `true` causes automatic deletion.
